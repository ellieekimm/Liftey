# Liftey
In this mini project, I created an application called Liftey!!! This application allows users to add a new exercise to their current workout. On top of this, they can also access their past workouts through the History Tab and view a summary. Currently, the History and Summary tabs are strictly UIs that don't take into account user input.

While making this project, I learned how to use TabView, Sheet, work with the transition modifier, and make sliding views in Swift!!
